\chapter{XRM: A Conceptual Model for XR}
\label{ch:conceptual-model}

According to the bibliographical research in \autoref{sec:background-conceptual}, most of the models described are referred to VEs, indeed there are few works dedicated to the design of mixed experiences. The conceptual model should guide designers in the creation and design of multi-reality and multi-platform experiences in order to build a communication bridge with the team that has to implement the application. Often these are complex systems combining 3D elements, physical objects, "behavior-rich content" \cite{walczak_structured_2008}, devices of different nature, single or shared experiences, indoor or outdoor etc. that severely challenge the developers, especially if they are always compelled to intervene directly on the code. The XR Conceptual Model Framework stems from the need to provide a tool capable of covering different technologies, including VR and AR. The approach used is centered on the human, the protagonist of different scenarios with the support of devices and platforms dependent on the experienced environment. The aim is to create a means to enable high-level development of XR applications, in order to involve also non-experts in the domain. 
In the light of the previous comparative and illustrative analysis, from the variety of conceptual models and based on the planned features, the ISS Model was chosen to inspire the upcoming model. The model of Gianotti et al.~\cite{dobbie_modeling_2020} provided a dual structure that allows for the systematic design of the static and dynamic parts of an XR experience. Although the environments considered have few points in common, the translation of the concepts was not too cumbersome and forced. The XR Conceptual Model Framework is also divided into two parts: a Structural and a Behavioral sub-model, which are described in the next section.
