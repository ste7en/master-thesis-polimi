\chapter{The ART Framework}
\label{ch:art}

The ART (Augmented Reality for Tourism) Framework is a project funded by EIT Digital in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano, Fifthingenium S.r.l.s., Technische Universit√§t Berlin and TIM that aims at creating an Extended Reality as a Service (XRaaS) platform to enhance tourism in places with a high historical, cultural and artistic value. Different stakeholders are involved, as tour operators, event organizers and museum curators, with the mission to create a unique tourist experience, starting from the demand stage to support the decision-making process for a destination to the on-site experience combining artistic locations with virtual tour guides and digital contents.

As we have described in \autoref{sec:background-tourism-xr} and \autoref{subsec:background-xr-future}, \gls{XR} technologies are finally mature to be widely deployed in the tourism sector, also thanks to the variety of devices coming on the market. Furthermore, a promising technology is 5G internet connection that will enable high-quality low-latency streaming of contents, higher download speeds, real-time interactions and multi-user experiences.

The ART project will hence provide a service for all the players involved in the tourism industry that allows the creation of \gls{XR} experiences without the need to code and deploy multiple applications but directly supporting the acquisition of digital contents, their processing and final transformation into assets downloadable and playable on different \gls{AR}/\gls{VR} devices where these experiences are rendered.

In this chapter, \autoref{sec:art-overview} will give an introduction to the technological stack of ART and the workflow that enables the creation of such apps; later, \autoref{sec:art-editor} will explain in detail the application supporting the authoring process of these experiences, presenting the ART Editor inspired by the conceptual model in \autoref{ch:conceptual-model} and its system design.
