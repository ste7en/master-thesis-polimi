\subsection{High-Level Design}
\label{subsec:art-editor-highlevel}

The high-level design of the ART Editor started from an analysis of goals and requirements in projecting and developing an XR application, considering the phases of the framework as described in \autoref{sec:art-overview}. Hence, this study was based on how to specify the run-time behaviour of virtual elements presented in \gls{AR}/\gls{VR} scenes. The goals of the \gls{XR} editor as a component of the ART Framework are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{G1}] The editor supports the design of AR and VR experiences
    \item[\textbf{G2}] The editor allows to model the interactions between users and virtual objects in a scene and the corresponding behaviour of the last ones
    \item[\textbf{G3}] The editor allows to model the interactions and behaviours on elements already uploaded on a Content Management System
    \item[\textbf{G4}] The editor is part of a workflow in the creation of XR experiences and allows to export a modelled environment, as well as load it
    \item[\textbf{G5}] The editor can describe the properties of the elements it supports and their changes
    \item[\textbf{G6}] The editor is based on a syntactically and semantically valid conceptual model
    \item[\textbf{G7}] The editor works on a web application for desktop browsers
\end{itemize}

After having understood which capabilities the XR editor needed to achieve, we started defining the functional requirements to meet during the development of the tool:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{R1}] The editor is based on the XRM Conceptual Model
    \item[\textbf{R2}] The editor represents user actions directly on the target elements
    \item[\textbf{R3}] The editor represents elements' run-time properties in 'states' of the application
    \item[\textbf{R4}] The editor allows a flow representation of the interactions
    \item[\textbf{R5}] The editor allows forking and merging of paths in the flow representation for conditional or logic modelling (e.g. logic AND, OR of interactions)
    \item[\textbf{R6}] The editor produces a schema of the modelled experience in order to be read and parsed by the on-site authoring tool
    \item[\textbf{R7}] The editor is able to edit previously modelled experiences
    \item[\textbf{R8}] The editor allows to change the different values of elements only when needed, keeping a clean \gls{UI}
    \item[\textbf{R9}] The editor allows an easy and intuitive UI in order to be used on desktop environments
    \item[\textbf{R10}] The editor allows a technology abstraction modelling
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Editor Specifications}
From the specifications above mentioned and the goals to achieve in order to support the ART Framework in the development of XR applications, we explored the concept (\autoref{fig:art-fsm-sketch}) of an editor representing its elements and their run-time structural properties as a state diagram (\autoref{fig:fsm}) typical of \glspl{FSM}: the behaviour of the application and its virtual objects is described by linked nodes in which user interactions -- corresponding to action nodes -- change the state of these elements, represented in state nodes.

\end{figure}

Being a desktop web-application we took full advantage of the web page layout that allows a wider organization of UI components compared to smaller devices (e.g. smartphones); we chose to represent the editor as a blank canvas in which it is possible to draw diagrams representing the XR experience.From the left-hand side panel, all previously loaded assets can be selected as available elements for the editor.
Another feature we thought would allow an easier and cleaner UI is the assignment of actions and properties to elements in the same way -- namely, using a decorator approach to show only relevant property assignments.
Furthermore, the configuration of the modelled experience can be exported, imported and modified using a file describing the diagram, so that it can be supported both by the on-site authoring phase and the interaction authoring phase.

\subsubsection*{Logic Decisions}
The logical high-level design choices consisted of determining the kinds of objects to be modelled in the editor and the actions performed by the user in the interaction. The XRM Conceptual Model in conjunction with the extensive literature review on XR applications in tourism (\autoref{sec:background-tourism-xr}) guided this process, whose first results consisted in choosing the entities (Non-Human Actors) of the XR experience listed in \autoref{table:xrm-art-actors}.

The following step was the definition of the states in which these elements can be distinguished: we decided to cluster the effects on these actors as atomic property modifiers in order to describe as few states as possible for these elements without losing many details in conceptual modelling; for these reasons we found that elements can be in one or more of the following states. \autoref{tab:art-compatible-objects} and \autoref{tab:art-compatible-states} show, respectively, an overview of the available states per entity and the compatibility among different states that can be associated to the same element.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visible} acts on the visibility property -- setting it to 'on' -- and its related opacity
    \item \textbf{Hidden} acts on the visibility property, setting it to 'off'
    \item \textbf{Blinking} enables a luminous border on the target object to attract users' attention
    \item \textbf{Selected} marks the component as selected for more interactions (e.g. manipulation, showing menus, etc.) on it
    \item \textbf{Unselected} deselects the component
    \item \textbf{Manipulated} indicates the component has been manipulated via rotation/translation/scaling
    \item \textbf{On Play} indicates when a multimedia entity is in playback
    \item \textbf{Paused} indicates when a multimedia entity is paused
    \item \textbf{Audio} changes the audio settings, turning it on or off
    \item \textbf{Subtitles} changes the subtitles settings, turning them on or off
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

The interactions, required to model virtual objects' changes of states, have been identified following the same process carried out for object states and inspired by XRM Behavioural Model's User Actions (\autoref{tab:BMUserActions}); starting from the table mentioned above, we chose some User Actions and adapted them to the editor and the entire ART Framework, defining their meaning and the objects on which these actions can be performed (\autoref{tab:art-compatible-actions}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Object Recognition} refers to the recognition of QR Codes by the application
    \item \textbf{Voice Command Recognition} is a specific feature for accessibility purposes (e.g. play a content by voice instead of tapping it)
    \item \textbf{Gesture Recognition} enables the modelling of complex gestures defined during the on-site authoring phase
    \item \textbf{Speech to Text} is the action of dictating a text input to the device
    \item \textbf{Proximity In} is the implicit action by a user approaching a virtual content or 3D Scene area
    \item \textbf{Proximity Out} is the implicit action by a user moving away from a virtual content or 3D Scene area
    \item \textbf{Gaze In} can represent both an implicit or explicit action from a user looking at an entity
    \item \textbf{Gaze Out} is the implicit action from a user averting their gaze from an entity
    \item \textbf{Tap} or Press, Click -- is the explicit action by the user on an entity
    \item \textbf{Pinch} is the usual pinch gesture to, for example, grab an object
    \item \textbf{Swipe} the gesture of moving a hand across a virtual object
    \item \textbf{Look Around} happens when the user moves their gaze, changing the field of view of a 360Â° Video
    \item \textbf{Hand Waving} is the usual hand waving gesture

In conclusion, we conceived a high-level schema of the editor by defining entities, states and actions for a state diagram model of the application to be modelled; each action applied to an entity in a given modelled state (i.e. a combination of its properties) carries the application and its elements to another state with different structural properties. The next sections will further describe the technological and design choices and how they have been implemented in a working prototype.
