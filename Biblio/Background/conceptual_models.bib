	abstract = {This paper explores the opportunities and challenges for Conceptual Modeling in the domain of Virtual Reality (VR). VR applications are becoming more feasible due to better and faster hardware, and due to new technology and faster network connections they also start to appear on the Internet. However, the development of such applications is still a specialized, time-consuming and expensive process. By introducing a Conceptual Modeling phase into the development process of VR applications, a number of the obstacles preventing a quick spread of this type of applications can be removed. However, existing Conceptual Modeling techniques are too limited for modeling a VR application in an appropriate way. The paper will show how Conceptual Modeling can be done for VR and how this may make VR more accessible to non VR-specialists. Furthermore, the paper will explain how Conceptual Modeling embedded in a semantic framework can provide the basis for semantically rich VR application, which may be essential for its success in the future and its use in the context of the Semantic Web. The paper will also point to some open research problems.},

            The main element of extended reality (XR) environments is behavior-rich 3D content consisting of objects that act and interact with one another as well as with users. Such actions and interactions constitute the evolution of the content over time. Multiple application domains of XR, e.g., education, training, marketing, merchandising, and design, could benefit from the analysis of 3D content changes based on general or domain knowledge comprehensible to average users or domain experts. Such analysis can be intended, in particular, to monitor, comprehend, examine, and control XR environments as well as users’ skills, experience, interests and preferences, and XR objects’ features. However, it is difficult to achieve as long as XR environments are developed with methods and tools that focus on programming and 3D modeling rather than expressing domain knowledge accompanying content users and objects, and their behavior. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to creating explorable knowledge-based XR environments with semantic annotations. The approach combines description logics with aspect-oriented programming, which enables knowledge representation in an arbitrary domain as well as transformation of available environments with minimal users’ effort. We have implemented the approach using well-established development tools and exemplify it with an explorable immersive car showroom. The approach enables efficient creation of explorable XR environments and knowledge acquisition from XR.},

Information design is a multidisciplinary endeavor involving data science, communication science, cognitive science, media, and technology. In the present paper the holodeck metaphor is extended to illustrate how information design practices and some of the qualities of this imaginary computationally augmented environment (a.k.a. the holodeck) may be achieved in XR environments to support information-rich storytelling and real life, face-to-face, and virtual collaborative interactions. The Simulation Experience Design Framework \& Method is introduced to organize challenges and opportunities in the design of information for XR. The notion of carefully blending both real and virtual spaces to achieve total immersion is discussed as the reader moves through the elements of the cyclical framework. A solution space leveraging cognitive science, information design, and transmedia learning highlights key challenges facing contemporary XR designers. Challenges include but are not limited to interleaving information, technology, and media into the human storytelling process, and supporting narratives in a way that is memorable, robust, and extendable. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

XR is an umbrella term that encompasses both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), among others. Despite the promising outlook, this nascent technology has been shrouded by uncertain possibilities, making the adoption of XR technology much slower than expected. Moreover, the interdisciplinary applications of XR technology have led to scattered scholarly works and fragmentary insights to be translated into practice. Thus, there is a pressing need for a critical review and synthesis of prior XR research in order to strengthen this emerging field in IS. To accomplish this, the current study identifies and analyses a total of 45 articles through an extensive literature search. As a result, this study identifies the major drivers, barriers, and boundary conditions to XR adoption, classifies and map them into a holistic conceptual model.

Given that MR technologies are still evolving, innovating new services that use them can be a difficult process. When designing a new service, scenarios play a vital role in helping to visualize the end product. By using a scenario, designers can explore the opportunities and pitfalls of the service. Prototypes, therefore, are highly desirable for enabling users to experience scenarios immersively. However, current MR devices have serious drawbacks such as a narrow field of view. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a scenario experience method with virtual reality (VR) technologies for MR service design. We compared a VR based scenario with an MR based scenario by evaluating Ambient Bot, which is an MR service with a 3D character floating around the user that provides information when looked at. By comparing the scenario experience when using the VR device with that of the MR device, we were able to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of the scenario experience in VR. © 2020 IEEE.},

We present a semantic-based interactive MR framework that is beyond current geometry-based approaches, offering a step change in generating high-level context-aware interactions. Our key insight is that by building semantic understanding in MR, we can develop a system that not only greatly enhances user experience through object-specific behaviours, but also it paves the way for solving complex interaction design challenges. In this paper, our proposed framework generates semantic properties of the real-world environment through a dense scene reconstruction and deep image understanding scheme. We demonstrate our approach by developing a material-aware prototype system for context-aware physical interactions between the real and virtual objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results show that the framework delivers accurate and consistent semantic information in an interactive MR environment, providing effective real-time semantic-level interactions. © 2019 The Authors.

Techniques to visualize 3D settings are explored with methods to conduct traditional storyboarding while requiring multiple viewpoints within a single timestep are elaborated. This is possible w/ perspective scene views. Even with 3D prototyping tools, it is important to maintain practices which optimize VR storyboarding and maintain spatial efficiency, allow storyboards to be hand drawn and be intuitive to read. A powerful solution is to bind several perspectives together to represent a specific time while reverting to a traditional single viewpoint when not necessary, therefore balancing three dimensionality, spatial efficiency \& ease of creation. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Our goal is to provide guidance for future evaluations of MR/AR approaches. To this end, we characterize publications by paper type (e.g., technique, design study), research topic (e.g., tracking, rendering), evaluation scenario (e.g., algorithm performance, user performance), cognitive aspects (e.g., perception, emotion), and the context in which evaluations were conducted (e.g., lab vs. in-thewild). We found a strong coupling of types, topics, and scenarios. We observe two groups: (a) technology-centric performance evaluations of algorithms that focus on improving tracking, displays, reconstruction, rendering, and calibration, and (b) human-centric studies that analyze implications of applications and design, human factors on perception, usability, decision making, emotion, and attention. Amongst the 458 papers, we identified 248 user studies that involved 5,761 participants in total, of whom only 1,619 were identified as female. We identified 43 data collection methods used to analyze 10 cognitive aspects. We found nine objective methods, and eight methods that support qualitative analysis. A majority (216/248) of user studies are conducted in a laboratory setting. Often (138/248), such studies involve participants in a static way. However, we also found a fair number (30/248) of in-the-wild studies that involve participants in a mobile fashion.

For instance, the number of GitHub repositories for XR related projects jumped from 51 in 2010 to over 15,000 in 2020. At the same time, the developer community approaches the creation of XR applications using inherited design processes and methods from past mainstream platforms such as web, mobile, or even product design. Unfortunately, those platforms do not consider the spatial aspects of these applications. In this paper, we present a revisited design process and a toolkit focused on the challenges innate to XR, that aims to help beginners and experienced teams in the creation of applications and interactions in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality. We also present a compendium of 113 techniques and 118 guidelines and a set of canvases that guides users through the process, preventing them from skipping important tasks and discoveries. At last, we present a pilot case where we accompany a team with developers and designers running our process and using our toolkit for the first time, showing the benefits of a process that strikes specific issues of XR apps. © 2020 IEEE.},

However, this can be physically and mentally challenging for some new VR users and users with limited mobility. To explore different options, we seek for various interaction design alternatives and customisation that might work alongside the teleport-style method for improved perceived ease-of-use and usefulness of the VR system. A user experience study is included in this article. The focus of this usability pilot study is to provide an on-going understanding of feasible interaction design approaches to be included in digital heritage VR projects. In this paper we describe the case study, prototype, a user evaluation study and directions for future work. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The development and maintenance of a virtual reality (VR) system requires indepth knowledge and understanding in many different disciplines. Three major features that distinguish VR systems are real-time performance while maintaining acceptable realism and presence, objects with two clearly distinct yet inter-related aspects like geometry/structure and function/behavior, and the still experimental nature of multi-modal interaction design. Until now, little attention has been paid to methods and tools for the structured development of VR software that addresses these features. Many VR application development projects proceed by modeling needed objects on conventional CAD systems, then programming the system using simulation packages. Usually, these activities are carried out without much planning, which may be acceptable for only small-scale or noncritical demonstration systems. However, for VR to be taken seriously as a media technology, a structural approach to developing VR applications is required for the construction of large-scale VR worlds, and this will undoubtedly involve and require complex resource management, abstractions for basic system/object functionalities and interaction tasks, and integration and easy plug-ins of different input and output methods. In this paper, we assembled a comprehensive structured methodology for building VR systems, called CLEVR (Concurrent and LEvel by Level Development of VR System), which combines several conventional and new concepts. For instance, we employ concepts such as the simultaneous consideration of form, function, and behavior, hierarchical modeling and top-down creation of LODs (levels of detail), incremental execution and performance tuning, user task and interaction modeling, and compositional reuse of VR objects. The basic underlying modeling approach is to design VR objects (and the scenes they compose) hierarchically and incrementally, considering their realism, presence, behavioral correctness, performance, and even usability in a spiral manner. To support this modeling strategy, we developed a collection of computeraided tools called P-VoT (POSTECH-Virtual reality system development Tool). We demonstrate our approach by illustrating a step-by-step design of a virtual ship simulator using the CLEVR/P-VoT, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in terms of the quality (performance and correctness) of the resulting software and reduced effort in its development and maintenance.},

              Our everyday lives are increasingly pervaded by digital assistants and smart devices forming the Internet of Things (IoT). While user interfaces to directly monitor and control individual IoT devices are becoming more sophisticated and end-user friendly, applications to connect standalone IoT devices and create more complex
              IoT processes
              for automating and assisting users with repetitive tasks still require a high level of technical expertise and programming knowledge. Related approaches for process modelling in IoT mostly suggest extensions to complex modelling languages, require high levels of abstraction and technical knowledge, and rely on unintuitive tools. We present a novel approach for end-user oriented-
              no-code
              -IoT process modelling using Mixed Reality (MR) technology:
              HoloFlows
              . Users are able to explore the IoT environment and model processes among sensors and actuators as first-class citizens by simply “drawing” virtual wires among physical IoT devices. MR technology hereby facilitates the understanding of the physical contexts and relations among the IoT devices and provides a new and more intuitive way of modelling IoT processes. The results of a user study comparing HoloFlows with classical modelling approaches show an increased user experience and decrease in required modelling knowledge and technical expertise to create IoT processes.},

	abstract = {Through the last decade, the creation of extended reality (XR) solutions has significantly increased due to the advent of cheaper, more advanced, and accessible instruments like smartphones, headsets, platforms, development kits, and engines. For instance, the number of GitHub repositories for XR related projects jumped from 51 in 2010 to over 15,000 in 2020. At the same time, the developer community approaches the creation of XR applications using inherited design processes and methods from past mainstream platforms such as web, mobile, or even product design. Unfortunately, those platforms do not consider the spatial aspects of these applications. In this paper, we present a revisited design process and a toolkit focused on the challenges innate to XR, that aims to help beginners and experienced teams in the creation of applications and interactions in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality. We also present a compendium of 113 techniques and 118 guidelines and a set of canvases that guides users through the process, preventing them from skipping important tasks and discoveries. At last, we present a pilot case where we accompany a team with developers and designers running our process and using our toolkit for the first time, showing the benefits of a process that strikes specific issues of XR apps. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A data model, called the entity-relationship model, is proposed. This model incorporates some of the important semantic information about the real world. A special diagrammatic technique is introduced as a tool for database design. An example of database design and description using the model and the diagrammatic technique is given. Some implications for data integrity, information retrieval, and data manipulation are discussed.
            The entity-relationship model can be used as a basis for unification of different views of data: the network model, the relational model, and the entity set model. Semantic ambiguities in these models are analyzed. Possible ways to derive their views of data from the entity-relationship model are presented.},
