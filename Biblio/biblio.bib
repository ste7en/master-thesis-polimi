    abstract = {For 11 studies, we find that the detection of usability problems as a function of
    number of users tested or heuristic evaluators employed is well modeled as a Poisson
    process. The model can be used to plan the amount of evaluation required to achieve
    desired levels of thoroughness or benefits. Results of early tests can provide estimates
    of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations
    needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection
    values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit
    ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a “medium” example,
    we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost
    ratio at four.},
